# Fundamentals

- Use Typescript and NodeJs
- Use oclif for the CLI framework
- Use Prettier for code formatting
- Install/update dependencies with npm from the CLI, not manually in package.json
- Prefer using the latest stable versions of dependencies
- Use ES modules, not CommonJS
- Prefer immutable data structures and pure functions where possible
- Use async/await for asynchronous code, not callbacks or .then()
- Prefer map, filter, reduce, and other functional programming methods for array manipulation, rather than for loops
- Use descriptive variable and function names that clearly indicate their purpose

# RevenueCat API

- Always use V2 of the API, never V1
- The API specification is available under docs/revenuecat-api-spec.yaml
